1.4,the textual description could have more details, the text doesn't always seem to fit with the formulas above
1.5,yes, I couldn't always understand how it was relevant with the formulas that were above it
1.6,I am not sure I could be able to describe the nature of the function based on the information. I think I am being biased from already knowing the answer

2.7,you can really see that the LJ potential can be approximated to a parabolic shape
2.8,you can see the approximation of the LJ potential to a parabolic curve for certain values of r but how it deviates when r changes
2.9,I feel that the text on the static plot is distracting, I however don't mind static plots in general. One could argue about the values of the parameters chosen for this plot without explanation
2.10,LJ potential behaves as a parabolic function for values of r close to r0 and deviates when r changes. The effect of the parameter epsilon is not clear on this plot, I can't tell how the function would evolve when changing the value of epsilon

3.11,how parameters change the nature of the functions
3.12,i would move the labels showing the value of epsilon, r0 and E and put them on the side so it doesn't overlap with the curves
3.13,changing the slider position to vary eps0
3.14,not necessarilzx interactions but I would remind the relationship between the different curves that are plotted
