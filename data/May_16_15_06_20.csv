1.1,5
1.2,8
1.3,10
1.4,missing data for the force (how can you relate it from an example)
1.5,yes
1.6,it's increasing up to rmin then it's decreasing
2.1,10
2.2,5
2.3,10
2.4,8
2.5,3
2.6,7
2.7,it behaves like a spring (kind of example that was missing from the text)
2.8,the repulsive and attractive part are well shown
2.9,yes
2.10,behaves like a spring

3.9,10
3.10,9
3.11,the potential, how does the real model match with the simplified one
3.12,missing the line which splits attractive\repuslive part
3.13,e0 to match with the taylor approximation 
3.14,make this split line
