1.1,8
1.2,7
1.3,8
1.4,We understand the force acting on theparticle and the energy related to their interaction
1.5,it is more distracting than the plots. Maybe add some more description on what are the given equation. Adding some comments on each equation to remind what it is
1.6,first the potential is concave and at higher distance it becomes convex

2.2,8
2.3,10
2.4,7
2.5,10
2.6,10
2.7,the forces reaches a maximum at a given distance and the approximation of the potential matches only to a certain degree the reality
2.8,the relation between the approximation and the reality, the relation between the force and energy
2.9,no
2.10,yes it is way easier to get the shape of the function

3.5,9
3.6,9
3.7,10
3.8,10
3.9,10
3.10,10
3.11,maybe add the value of the maxima of the force
3.12,I think we understand less the variation of the curve when we vary r0 than when we vary eps0
3.13,eps0
3.14,EMPTY
