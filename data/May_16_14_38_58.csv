1.4,Not much, that there is a mathematical relation between the force and the potential
1.5,No, the text helps to understand better the equations, but not enough to be able to understand the concept behind them.
1.6,as you increase the distance, the force decreases

2.7,when the distance is below a certain value, the absolute value of the force increases radically
2.8,The steps of approximations used in order to get the final force plot
2.9,No, the only missing thing is visualising the physical concept
2.10,The equilibrium, where the force is zero, is easily found, here at r=1.0

3.11,as eps0 increases, the equilibrium is more stable
3.12,The y=0 line isn't represented, hence, hard to see where the equilibrium is.
3.13,the r0, as it's dimension is more familiar, I know exactly what it represents
3.14,an interaction with two atoms where you can approach them to each other and change r, and have a cursor that follows the lgraphs
